Since mod_vhs 1.1.0
-------------------
o Update and add documentation
  (Rene Kanzler)
o Store results of DBD/LDAP requests in mod_vhs connection configuration
  to prevent new DBD/LDAP queries for currently-open connections.
  (Rene Kanzler)
o Splited code into smaller files and moved to include folder. 
  Moved documentation to the doc folder.
  (Rene Kanzler)
o Replace the the hard coded mod_DBD SQL query with the DBDPrepareSQL label
  (Rene Kanzler)
o Added memcached support
  (Rene Kanzler)
o Add documentation about LDAP setup.
  (Xavier Beaudouin)
o Fix LDAP search.
  (Xavier Beaudouin)
o For LDAP, allow DocumentRoot give from LDAP Posix attribute 
  homeDirectory. 
  (Xavier Beaudouin)
o For LDAP, add the option to specify a different filter than:
  (&(FilterinUrl)(|(apacheServerName=%s)(apacheServerAlias=%s))).
  (Xavier Beaudouin)
o Since PHP 5.3 doesn't use safe_mode, we don't need it. If you 
  still need it because you use an old PHP, please set -DOLD_PHP.
  Notice this code will NOT be maintained anymore
  (Xavier Beaudouin)
o Fix bug in lamers mode (Guillaume de Lafond, Dinde, ....)
o mod_dbd support merged into mod_vhs (Thanks to Guillaume de Lafond to
  port MySolo module into mod_vhs).
  Current SQL query is now :
  SELECT ServerName, ServerAdmin, DocumentRoot, suexec_uid, suexec_gid, 
         php_env, associateddomain, isalias 
  FROM The_Table 
  WHERE ServerName = %s AND active = 'yes'"
  "The_Table" is given with apache configuration :
  vhs_VhostDBDTable
o Splited code into 3 files, smaller files, better to work with.
  (Guillaume de Lafond)
o Added #defines to avoid LDAP stuff to be compiled when apache 
  doesn't have LDAP support (Guillaume de Lafond)
o Added mpm-itk support (Thanks to Guillaume de Lafond to port patch)
o Added mod_ldap support

o Added support for suphp for non-systems users (Stephane Locatelli)
  This allow suphp support when it is compiled with "force" mode and
  don't break compatibility with "owner" mode.
o Added some procompilators options to avoir incompatibility between MOD_SUPHP
  and MOD_VHS 

Since mod_vhs 1.0.32

o Fixed some errors if #ifdef when using THREADS

Since mod_vhs 1.0.28

o Added Makefile instead of using scripts
o Now mod_vhs should compile correctly under Debian/SARGE

Since mod_vhs 1.0.26
--------------------
o Added note about regexp problems with libhome
o Fixed a segfault when php entries are not corrects.

Since mod_vhs 1.0.24

o Fix some missing path values when used vhs_Path_Prefix
o Compile only what is needed. eg don't include php code or config
  variables when PHP support is not compiled into.

Since mod_vhs 1.0.22
--------------------
o Fixed openbasedir append function that didn't worked as it should.
o Fixed debug for openbasedir stuff.
o Added warning about Apache2 NameVirtualHost oddyty ...

Since mod_vhs 1.0.20
--------------------

  configuration option is now removed

  into apache error log when a host or a path is not found. Patch by 
  Raphaël Jeudy.

Since mod_vhs 1.0.18
--------------------
o Removed VH_HOST variable since it is more or less unusuable and somewhat
  dangerous. You can enable it again by compiling mod_vhs with -DWANT_VH_HOST.
o Fixed compilation of mod_vhs when using Apache 2.0 branch (problems
  with ap_regex_t that exists only on Apache 2.1)
o Added open_basedir functions to append homedir to a default open_basedir
  path.
o Added experimental SUEXEC support. Not tested and not documented !
o According to Frédéric VANNIERE, mod_rewrite don't work when it
  is specified in module list... Another neat exception of Apache...
  Now mod_vhs should work with mod_rewrite...

  of this code on Debian

o Added mod_alias "compatible" configuration values, eg : vhs_Alias, 
  vhs_ScriptAlias, vhs_Redirect, vhs_AliasMatch, vhs_ScriptAliasMatch,
  vhs_RedirectMatch, vhs_RedirectTemp and vhs_RedirectPermanent configuration
  directives. See mod_alias manual for more informations.


Since mod_vhs 1.0.12
--------------------

o Added option vhs_PHPdisplay_errors used on PHP support to show 
  php errors when needed on <VirtualHost></> basis.
o Added options on load that mod_vhs wait for input from mod_alias and
  mod_userdir before mod_vhs make things works.

  and mod_php is making their works.
o Added option vhs_Default_Host_Redirect (on/off) to force HTTP redirect
  if default host is triggered.
o The module should be now threads safe. Note that we don't garantee
  that your Apache will still be thread safe if you use non thread
  safe module (like mod_php for example).
o Add support for PHP 4.3.x. The following entries are modified according
  to <VirtualHost></> httpd.conf.
  Example :

   <VirtualHost 1.2.3.4>
   vhs_Default_Host www.mydomain.com
   vhs_PHPsafe_mode On
   vhs_PHPopen_basedir On
   </VirtualHost>


   <VirtualHost 1.2.3.5>
   vhs_Default_Host www.mydomain.com
   vhs_PHPsafe_mode Off
   vhs_PHPopen_basedir Off
   </VirtualHost>
