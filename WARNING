WARNING About NameVirtualHost oddyty

It seems that Apache 2 has some odd comportement with mod_vhs.

If you have :

NameVirtualHost x.x.x.x
<VirtualHost x.x.x.x>

And your have some problems with redirect that give you some 
random pages when a host is not found on the database.

Then you should change a bit your configuration to the
following :

NameVirtualHost x.x.x.x:80
<VirtualHost x.x.x.x:80>

And the problem should be fixed.

This was reported by Raphaël JEUDY on IRC.
